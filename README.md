# python-django

A sample Python Django application.

I am also going to build and deploy this using Docker.

I am working off this as the base and adding the Docker parts

<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/quickstart-python>

## Docker setup

Docker doesn't ship with bash, so either run ash or sh.

docker run -it alpine /bin/ash

### RUN

These are the commands needed to get the packages and dependencies on the VM for the project.
