# python-django

A sample Python Django application.

I am also going to build and deploy this using Docker.

## Docker setup

Docker doesn't ship with bash, so either run ash or sh.

docker run -it alpine /bin/ash

### RUN

These are the commands needed to get the packages and dependencies on the VM for the project.
